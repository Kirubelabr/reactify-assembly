# Getting Started with Reactify Assembly

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App and Craco](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.

I've added a `web.config.js` file to change `port of the project so it'll be available on port 9000.` you can change the port if desired.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



# About the project

This project is made with `create-react-app` alongside with `craco` to showcase how much I am familiar with `React`. You should not expect this as a completed project. I just modified my personal project which already exists in `Angular` and there are features that are not included here.

I've added data fetching using API calls to get few data from server which is in my local machine. You might not be able to `sign-in` or get any data access for the moment. I did this to avoid using `json-server` and I wanted to include `Authentication` and `Authorization` methods in the app. So, it'll feel a real world application.

## Technologies Used

* React - V17
* Antd - for UI elements
* TailwindCSS - as CSS utility
* Craco - to override React configurations (and also to look fancy lol)
* React router dom - for page navigation
* axios - for API call
